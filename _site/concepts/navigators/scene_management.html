<p>As Scenes have absolutely no knowledge of any navigation flow, they will need to
notify a component that does of events that should trigger a change in scenery.
Naturally, a Navigator is perfect for that.
The Navigator can listen to a Scene’s events and react accordingly, for example
by switching to another Scene.</p>

<p>Depending on the way the flow is modelled in the Navigator, the lifecycle of its
Scenes can behave differently.
In case of a stack for example, the Scene that is being replaced can either be
made inactive or be destroyed depending on whether a new Scene is pushed onto
the stack, or whether the Scene is popped off of the stack.
A Navigator that does not use a back stack may have completely different behavior
with respect to its Scene’s lifecycles.
This means that the Navigator is completely responsible for the lifecycle of the
Scenes, and <em>must</em> make the proper calls at the proper times.</p>

<p>When implementing your own Navigator instance, a few general guidelines can be
followed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scenes need to be started and stopped.
When a Scene becomes the active Scene, a call to its <code class="highlighter-rouge">onStart</code> method should
be made.
If there already was an active Scene, its <code class="highlighter-rouge">onStop</code> method may be called.</li>
  <li>Scenes must be destroyed.
If a Scene has served its purpose in the Navigator, a call to its <code class="highlighter-rouge">onDestroy</code>
method must be made.
If the Scene was active at this point, a call to its <code class="highlighter-rouge">onStop</code> method <em>must be
made before</em> the call to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">onDestroy</code> method.</li>
  <li>Scenes follow the Navigator lifecycle.
If a Navigator enters its ‘stopped’ state, all of its Scene should enter their
‘stopped’ state as well.
If a Navigator is destroyed, Scenes must be destroyed as well following their
lifecycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>These guidelines are just that: guidelines.
If it makes sense for your Navigator to deviate from them, please do.
Just make sure you understand the consequences if you do.</p>
